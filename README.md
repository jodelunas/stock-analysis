# Refactoring VBA

## Overview of Project

The purpose of his project was to refactor the previous solution code to see if refactoring shortened the length of time for the code to run.

## Results

Both codes produced the same results, showing 2017 was a much better year. By refactoring, and creating a ticker index with the code Dim tickerIndex As Integer it ran much faster. This allowed for all tickers to be run simutaneously. The differences in time are shown in the images below.

## Summary

The advantage of refactoring code, is to make it run more efficiently and faster. The disadvantage is that you are more likely to run into errors, and will take  more time to write.

In this challange the refactored code ran much faster, but the change didn't make enough of a difference for the time it took to refactor it.
